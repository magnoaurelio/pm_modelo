<p>Given the ubiquity of street photography, it can now be easier to trend-spot outside fashion shows than inside. Case in point: the big and bold retro skirts so many women were wearing at the shows last month. You almost expected Carmel Snow to pull up in a Cadillac Brougham. Zanita Morgan, a model turned blogger and photographer, was a latter-day Grace Kelly in a voluminous skirt and angora sweater; Eva Chen, the Lucky editor, was uptown chic in a brocade Tibi; and Eleanor Strauss, the style director of Shopbop, wore a shorter style with a fitted crop top and leather jacket. While the days are still mild, you can pull off a hint-of-skin top under a leather jacket or peacoat.</p>
<p>For winter, try a relaxed-fit pullover and a waist-cinching coat that hits a few inches above the hemline of the skirt. Or for a different play on proportions, match with a slim turtleneck and short boxy jacket. On your feet: tall boots or ladylike heels. And, unless you’re perversely proud of your undergarments, beware of those subway grates.<br />
Under It All, the Poetry of Silk</p>
<p>True &amp; Co., an e-commerce site founded in 2012 to make bra shopping a less fraught experience — there’s an online fit quiz and a home try-on service — has enlisted Nikki Dekker of the cultish lingerie line the Lake &amp; Stars to design a private label collection. Called She Walks in Beauty (+ Light), Ms. Dekker’s collection (she’s also the site’s new creative director) is appealing in the way that Lake &amp; Stars is, with undies that can be layered and worn as outerwear. They’re done in luxe silk and a soft color palette, with patterned straps, cutouts and contrast closures, all at accessible prices of $24 to $94. This plunging bodysuit, available in black or mint with black straps, at $94, is a sexy piece to layer under a sharp jacket.

<p><strong>Worthy of a Song Or at Least A Bit of Boasting</strong></p>
<p>In its first season, Kara, a line of smart everyday handbags, was impressively picked up by Opening Ceremony, Harvey Nichols in London and Lane Crawford in Hong Kong. Designed by Sarah Law, who worked as an accessories designer at Gap, the line, including a pebble leather backpack that keeps selling out, is easy, cool and affordable. (The name is borrowed from one of her favorite activities, karaoke.) “I don’t really buy things that are over $1,000,” Ms. Law said of her moderate pricing. “I’ve maybe done it once in my life, and it was a really big deal.” Her new resort collection has backpacks and smaller stowaway bags in speckled cream calf-hair and mesh, but we are especially fond of this dry bag, which has an adjustable strap so it can also be carried as a bucket bag.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 7. We’ve had the rumours, we’ve had the help-the-newness-of-it-all-is-making-me-feel-sick phase, now it’s time for the tips and tricks]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple’s new operating system has refreshed the asthetics of your iPhone, but it’s also added several small, cool features and sorted out some old bugs we like the grumble about.</p>
<p>If you haven’t given in and updated yet, here’s 12 reasons why you should.</p>
<ol>
<li>Quit multiple apps at once<br />
Closing down apps to preserve battery life was one of the early ‘little known iPhone tips’. Now you can close several at a time. Double click the home button as usual, then use three fingers to swipe three apps at once.</li>
<li>Use the Instagram crop in camera mode<br />
The camera app can now take square photos, meaning whatever plate of food, Autumnal scene or vacuous selfie you want to share with the world on Instagram will always appear in full.</li>
<li>In built spirit level<br />
A niche tool, admittedly, but useful none the less. The compass app now also acts as a spirit level, meaning you can not only navigate your way around the world but perfectly straighten every picture you see on your way.</li>
<li>Siri can be corrected<br />
If you’re the type of person who doesn’t mind using voice activation on your mobile phone in public, at least you can now do it more accurately. Siri – whose voice you can also change – can be taught to get things right with a stern ‘that’s not how you pronounce that’. So now you can only talk to your phone, but tell it off, too.</li>
<li>Set your own vibrations<br />
Too much of a maverick for the basic 4/4 beat? OK jazz man, just go to Settings&gt;Sounds&gt;Ringtone&gt;Vibration&gt;Create New Vibration and you can set the iPhone to tickle your thigh to your own rhythm.</li>
<li>Block whoever you like<br />
Debt collectors, charity workers and unhinged exes can all now be block from your life for good via a handy new tool – just go to Settings&gt;Phone&gt;Blocked to get started.</li>
<li>Text message time stamps that last forever<br />
Settling an argument? Writing your autobiography? Providing a police alibi? All can be aided by the fact time stamps now last on every text message you send or receive forever, by just sliding them to the left.</li>
<li>The clock icon is a now real clock<br />
With a ticking second hand, and everything.</li>
<li>Maps has a night mode<br />
To help cut down on fatal car accidents and muggings, Apple maps now has a handy night mode, meaning the display will be darker and less distracting at certain times.</li>
<li>Unlimited folder space<br />
A great one for all you OCD sufferers out there. You can now places as many app icons in a single folder as you want, meaning your home screen can be as neat and tidy as you are.</li>
<li>Automatic app updates<br />
No more going into iTunes to get the latest version of Tinder – you can set your iPhone to be constantly updating apps automatically.</li>
<li>Birthday wishes<br />
The iPhone is now a bit cannier with the information you give it, meaning if you tell it your address, it can remind you to do things when you get home. Tragically, if you tell it your date of birth it will wish you well when the day arrives. You popular guy, you.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Swiftly making their way up the ranks as king of the fast-food world are the freshly prepared, simple, and dangerously moreish, burritos.</p>
<p>Here we round up five of the best places in London to grab one.</p>
<ol>
<li>Poncho 8Providing a healthier burrito option for the people of London (you can check the nutritional values online), ex-financial businessmen Frank Yeung and Nick Troen first set up shop in Spitalfields back in September 2009. They now boast five outlets including St Pauls and Soho.Using only the finest ingredients, Poncho 8 marinate their chicken in lime juice, cumin and paprika, while their pork is smothered in juniper berries, bay leaves and fresh oregano before slow cooked to juicy perfection.Their branded chili is also available from Harvey Nichols, and comes in three great flavours – Smoky Medium, Garlic and Super Hot Fuego (that’s ‘fire’ in Spanish).
<p>poncho8.com</li>
<li>ChilangoBack in 2006 founders Eric and Dan embarked on a gastronomical adventure to Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco (it’s a hard life) in order to bring the best of the Mexican flavours to London. And so far they’ve done a pretty good job.From chili-marinated steak to oven-braised pork – which includes the deliciously charred fatty edges, each burrito is filled with a generous dollop of coriander-lime rice, cheese/sour cream, beans and chunky homemade salsa.chilango.co.uk</li>
<li>Daddy DonkeyTucked away on Leather Lane, the self-proclaimed ‘kick-ass Mexican grill’ Daddy Donkey does exactly that – serve a kick-ass Mexican grill. Started by Joel Henderson back in 2005, the burrito cart serves the Daddy D burrito – a ‘big-ass’ flour tortilla with all the usuals. Choose from five fillings including Carnitas (pulled pork shoulder &amp; leg, slow cooked in garlic, spice and coca-cola) and marinated chargrilled chicken. And of course don’t forget to ask for a shot of guacamole at the end.With market-goers and lunchtime traders it gets pretty busy at lunchtime, so get there early to avoid disappointment.daddydonkey.co.uk</li>
<li>LuardosSince 2006, Luardos’ Jesus H Van (it’s blue) have been serving homemade burritos – also known to locals as the perfect hangover cure – stuffed with your choice of meat (chicken breast, carnitas, chipotle or beef), black beans, tomato salsa, sour cream, lettuce and fresh coriander. If you fancy a double dose of meat, you can always add extra chorizo.His hot sister van Mary (yes, it’s pink) is the one who ‘gets around’ so make sure you follow her on Twitter for regular updates on where she’ll be next. Expect a lengthy queue during lunchtimes.luardos.co.uk</li>
<li>Freebird BurritosDangerously close to the Esquire offices on Berwick Street Market, this burrito stand offers a fuss free, faster-than-light service.There are three easy steps to follow: pick the meal, pick the meat – our pick of the bunch is the tender medium-rare marinated steak – and add a generous portion of salsa. To really kick it up a notch we recommend you go for the Smoky Medium – a tomatillo based salsa with fresh herbs &amp; seasoning with, you guessed it, a smoky twist.</li>

<p>November heralds a month of moustaches (of varying success rates) thanks to the Movember charity appeal. For 30 days the non-whiskered become the whiskered – it’s hirsuteness’ moment in the sun! – helping to raise funds and awareness for men’s health issues.</p>
<p>This year, Ted’s Grooming Room – Ted Baker’s space for everything sprucing – is lending a dapper hand. Services at each six of its venues range from haircuts to skincare, as well as offering guests traditional Turkish shaves.</p>
<p>Ted’s Grooming Room will be offering complimentary shaves on 1 November between 9-11am, tash trims anytime, all month long and, best of all, a tash-off on 30 November between 9-11am.</p>
<p>Hair on your upper lip, complimentary grooming, a good cause – we’ll see you there.</p>
