				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we think of cardiovascular health, physical activity – such as running – often comes to mind. But new research shows that running a marathon can prompt heart muscle changes that cause the heart to swell, and this is particularly the case in runners with lower fitness levels.</p>
<p>The researchers, who reported their findings in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology, say previous studies have found that many sports competitors show signs of injury to the heart muscle and cardiac abnormalities after they exercise for long periods of time.</p>
<p>The new study was created to assess the degree to which running a marathon stresses the heart, and whether it might cause permanent damage.</p>
<p>As such, the researchers studied 20 amateur long-distance runners between the ages of 18 and 60, who were going to run in the Quebec City Marathon. The runners had no known cardiovascular disease and were not on any kind of drug treatment.</p>
<p>The researchers excluded any runners who had run a marathon in the 2 months before recruitment or during the study period.<br />
Cardiac risk associated with running</p>
<p>Tested 6-8 weeks before the marathon and on the day of the race, the runners were also tested again within 48 hours of completing the marathon. This test included a second MRI and blood sampling.</p>
<p>The researchers say this timeframe ensured sufficient rehydration and a return to normal heart and blood pressure rates after the race. But importantly, it was short enough for them to observe any myocardial changes.</p>
<p>In half of the runners, researchers observed that the marathon prompted a decrease in left and right ventricular function. And when a lot of the heart was affected, there was swelling and reduced blood flow in the heart.</p>
<p>Dr. Eric Larose, of the Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec (IUCPQ) in Canada, says that the heart muscle changes they observed were more common in runners who had lower fitness levels and who trained less.</p>
<p>But they also observed that these changes were temporary.</p>
<p>Dr. Larose says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Segmental function decrease is associated with poor prognosis in the presence of CAD (coronary artery disease) or cardiomyopathy. Segmental dysfunction also indicates a poor prognosis in adults without cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>Although we don’t know whether such changes mean that recreational runners are at risk, the attendant edema, and reduced perfusion suggest transient injury</p></blockquote>

<p>Given the ubiquity of street photography, it can now be easier to trend-spot outside fashion shows than inside. Case in point: the big and bold retro skirts so many women were wearing at the shows last month. You almost expected Carmel Snow to pull up in a Cadillac Brougham. Zanita Morgan, a model turned blogger and photographer, was a latter-day Grace Kelly in a voluminous skirt and angora sweater; Eva Chen, the Lucky editor, was uptown chic in a brocade Tibi; and Eleanor Strauss, the style director of Shopbop, wore a shorter style with a fitted crop top and leather jacket. While the days are still mild, you can pull off a hint-of-skin top under a leather jacket or peacoat.</p>
<p>For winter, try a relaxed-fit pullover and a waist-cinching coat that hits a few inches above the hemline of the skirt. Or for a different play on proportions, match with a slim turtleneck and short boxy jacket. On your feet: tall boots or ladylike heels. And, unless you’re perversely proud of your undergarments, beware of those subway grates.<br />
Under It All, the Poetry of Silk</p>
<p>True &amp; Co., an e-commerce site founded in 2012 to make bra shopping a less fraught experience — there’s an online fit quiz and a home try-on service — has enlisted Nikki Dekker of the cultish lingerie line the Lake &amp; Stars to design a private label collection. Called She Walks in Beauty (+ Light), Ms. Dekker’s collection (she’s also the site’s new creative director) is appealing in the way that Lake &amp; Stars is, with undies that can be layered and worn as outerwear. They’re done in luxe silk and a soft color palette, with patterned straps, cutouts and contrast closures, all at accessible prices of $24 to $94. This plunging bodysuit, available in black or mint with black straps, at $94, is a sexy piece to layer under a sharp jacket.

<p><strong>Worthy of a Song Or at Least A Bit of Boasting</strong></p>
<p>In its first season, Kara, a line of smart everyday handbags, was impressively picked up by Opening Ceremony, Harvey Nichols in London and Lane Crawford in Hong Kong. Designed by Sarah Law, who worked as an accessories designer at Gap, the line, including a pebble leather backpack that keeps selling out, is easy, cool and affordable. (The name is borrowed from one of her favorite activities, karaoke.) “I don’t really buy things that are over $1,000,” Ms. Law said of her moderate pricing. “I’ve maybe done it once in my life, and it was a really big deal.” Her new resort collection has backpacks and smaller stowaway bags in speckled cream calf-hair and mesh, but we are especially fond of this dry bag, which has an adjustable strap so it can also be carried as a bucket bag.</p>

<li>This is what we are doing.</li>
<li>This is how we are going to do it.</li>

<p>They have a feeling of inevitability about them. This team knows their shit. They are going to do this. Someone will fund them. If we don’t fund them, we’ll lose the deal.</p>
<p>This means that the majority of the content of the pitch deck should be content that the startup already has. Not content they created to impress investors.I help a lot of people with their pitch decks. Many of them, once they get an investor meeting on the calendar, scramble to put together a story:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is our business model?</li>
<li>Who is our competition?</li>
<li>What is our go-to-market?</li>
</ul>
<p>They anticipate these questions coming from the VCs, so they scramble to put together compelling answers.You don’t need answers to these question to impress VCs. You need the answers because you need the answers.</p>
<p>If you are throwing together answers to these questions purely to placate an investor, that means you don’t know the answers. It also means that you think the kind of annoying questions VCs ask, like “what is your sales model?” and “what is your lead generation strategy?” are just annoying investor speak and are not 90% of how you should be spending your time anyway.<div class="share-box pull-right"><ul class="clearfix"><li class="clearfix"><a class="pull-left t-first" href="mailto:?subject=Passion: Before Royalty&amp;body=I%20recommend%20this%20page%3A%20Before%20Royalty.%20You%20can%20read%20it%20on%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fupsidethemes.net%2Fdemo%2Fpassion%2F%3Fp%3D52"><span class="fa fa-envelope-o"></span>Mail</a><a class="pull-left" href="javascript:window.print();"><span class="fa fa-print"></span>Print</a></li><li class="clearfix"><div class="pull-left social-links"><span class="clearfix"><span class="fa fa-google-plus"></span>Share</span><ul><li><a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Before Royalty:+https%3A%2F%2Fupsidethemes.net%2Fdemo%2Fpassion%2F%3Fp%3D52"><span class="fa fa-twitter"></span>Twitter</a></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fupsidethemes.net%2Fdemo%2Fpassion%2F%3Fp%3D52"><span class="fa fa-facebook"></span>Facebook</a></li><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fupsidethemes.net%2Fdemo%2Fpassion%2F%3Fp%3D52"><span class="fa fa-google-plus"></span>Google +</a></li></ul></div><a class="pull-left" href="#respond"><span class="fa fa-comment-o entry-icon"></span> Comments</a></li></ul></div></p>
<p>A VC will not ask you a single question that you shouldn’t have come up with on your own, and if you don’t already have solid answers to them, you aren’t ready to raise money.</p>
<p>VCs can sniff out the difference between entrepreneurs who are asking permission to start their business vs. ones who know their shit and will do it with or without them.</p>
<p>Treat VC as a means to an end, not as the people you need to ask permission to before you can start your business. Investors respond to that and are likely to jump on board.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MOST Americans who lose their jobs these days are able to find new ones quickly. But those who do not are likely to remain unemployed for a long time. In some other industrialized countries, long-term unemployment has risen to record levels, even as overall unemployment has begun to decline.</p>
<div class="video-wrapper"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/70301553?title=0&byline=0&portrait=1&color=00adef" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>“This is a major source of concern,” said Stefano Scarpetta, the director for employment, labor and social affairs at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, whose members are 34 mostly developed countries. “For people who have been out for a long time, it becomes very difficult to get back into jobs. People lose motivation. They lose employment skills.”</p>
<p>In the United States, as can be seen in the accompanying charts, the percentage of the labor force that has been out of work for more than a year — and is still seeking employment — is down to 1.9 percent from a peak of 3 percent reached in 2010. But that proportion is still higher than at any time before 2009. (The data goes back to 1948.)</p>
<p>More than a quarter of the unemployed workers in the United States say they have been out of work for at least a year, and that does not count those who have given up looking, since they are no longer counted as unemployed. That is down from nearly a third at the peak of the recession, but far higher than it had ever been before the recession that began in 2007.</p>
<p>The United States figures on long-term unemployment, while bad by precrisis levels, are actually better than in many other countries. For the euro zone countries, nearly half of those who were unemployed in the second quarter of this year had been out of work for at least a year. In Greece, the figure was 65 percent. Even in prosperous Germany, the figure was 45 percent. In Britain, it was 37 percent.</p>
<p>For 32 O.E.C.D. countries — data for Chile and South Korea was not available — the overall figure was 36 percent.</p>
<p>Of the countries shown in the charts, only Canada, Australia, Turkey and Norway have a lower proportion of unemployed people who have been out of work for a year or more.</p>
<p>Mr. Scarpetta, whose organization prepared the figures, said governments needed to concentrate their efforts. “Acting quickly is important,” he said. “If you have a large pool of long-term unemployed, you should focus on them.”</p>
<p>He pointed to the rising number of people under the age of 25 who are not in employment, education or training — called Neets by the O.E.C.D. In the United States, in the final quarter of last year, 15 percent of youths were in that group, up from 12 percent in the same period of 2007. In Italy, the figure was 21.4 percent, but it was just 7.6 percent in Germany.</p>
<p>By contrast, the short-term unemployment rate — the proportion of the work force that has been out of work for four weeks or less — is now 1.7 percent in the United States. That is only a little above the record low of 1.5 percent set in 2007, and lower than any such monthly rate reached between 1953 and 2004.<div class="share-box pull-right"><ul class="clearfix"><li class="clearfix"><a class="pull-left t-first" href="mailto:?subject=Passion: Envato Launches the Microlancer Creative Marketplace&amp;body=I%20recommend%20this%20page%3A%20Envato%20Launches%20the%20Microlancer%20Creative%20Marketplace.%20You%20can%20read%20it%20on%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fupsidethemes.net%2Fdemo%2Fpassion%2F%3Fp%3D37"><span class="fa fa-envelope-o"></span>Mail</a><a class="pull-left" href="javascript:window.print();"><span class="fa fa-print"></span>Print</a></li><li class="clearfix"><div class="pull-left social-links"><span class="clearfix"><span class="fa fa-google-plus"></span>Share</span><ul><li><a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Envato Launches the Microlancer Creative Marketplace:+https%3A%2F%2Fupsidethemes.net%2Fdemo%2Fpassion%2F%3Fp%3D37"><span class="fa fa-twitter"></span>Twitter</a></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fupsidethemes.net%2Fdemo%2Fpassion%2F%3Fp%3D37"><span class="fa fa-facebook"></span>Facebook</a></li><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fupsidethemes.net%2Fdemo%2Fpassion%2F%3Fp%3D37"><span class="fa fa-google-plus"></span>Google +</a></li></ul></div><a class="pull-left" href="#respond"><span class="fa fa-comment-o entry-icon"></span> Comments</a></li></ul></div></p>
<p>There are now more people who have been out of work for a year than there are who have been out of work for four weeks or less. Until 2009, that had not happened since World War II. At the worst point after the 2001 recession, more than 30 percent of the unemployed had been out of work for less than a month, at least twice the number who had been out of work for a year.</p>
<p>In the United States, and many other countries, there is now what amounts to a two-tier employment system. For most people, unemployment is likely to be brief, if it happens at all. But for a significant number of people, unemployment is anything but a temporary problem.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F79756040&visual=true&color=ff6600&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true"></iframe>
<p>While Burberry was all about romance for Fall 2013, Miuccia Prada’s campaigns for both Prada and Miu Miu veered towards the dark and surreal.</p>
<p>Shot by photographer Steven Meisel under the hair-raising light of a cold and ominous casting studio, Prada’s Fall 2013 campaign serves as the perfect setting to showcase the film noir glamour of the fall collection. The campaign’s short film stars 9 models, who play the roles of hopeful actresses, preparing for auditions and reciting lines. The dark and desolate theme mirrored that of Prada’s Fall 2013 fashion week show in which models walked down a shadow-clad runway. Miuccia Prada, the designer behind the label, was quoted post-show by style.com saying “through cloth, you can really make movies,” reinforcing the theme of the campaign.</p>
<p>The short film stands out our radar for both it’s seriously dramatic tone and because of an appearance by 19-year-old model Malaika Firth, the first black model cast by the brand in almost two decades. Firth holds her own alongside top models Christy Turlington and Freja Beha which is a feat to say the least. The 9 model-strong cast is reminiscent of the label’s much lighter Spring 2013 advertising campaign, also shot by Meisel, in which 10 models embodied the delicate, frilly characteristics of flowers featured on garments in the Spring 2013 collection.</p>
<p>An equally dazzling cast of models is found in Miu Miu’s Fall 2013 campaign, which shows off the collection’s vivid colours and bold patterns against the moody backdrop of a seaside pier at twilight. Directed by Inez &amp; Vinoodh, the campaign features a roster of It girls including Georgia May Jagger, Adriana Lima and Lindsey Wixson.<div class="share-box pull-right"><ul class="clearfix"><li class="clearfix"><a class="pull-left t-first" href="mailto:?subject=Passion: Prada and Miu Miu&amp;body=I%20recommend%20this%20page%3A%20Prada%20and%20Miu%20Miu.%20You%20can%20read%20it%20on%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fupsidethemes.net%2Fdemo%2Fpassion%2F%3Fp%3D34"><span class="fa fa-envelope-o"></span>Mail</a><a class="pull-left" href="javascript:window.print();"><span class="fa fa-print"></span>Print</a></li><li class="clearfix"><div class="pull-left social-links"><span class="clearfix"><span class="fa fa-google-plus"></span>Share</span><ul><li><a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Prada and Miu Miu:+https%3A%2F%2Fupsidethemes.net%2Fdemo%2Fpassion%2F%3Fp%3D34"><span class="fa fa-twitter"></span>Twitter</a></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fupsidethemes.net%2Fdemo%2Fpassion%2F%3Fp%3D34"><span class="fa fa-facebook"></span>Facebook</a></li><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fupsidethemes.net%2Fdemo%2Fpassion%2F%3Fp%3D34"><span class="fa fa-google-plus"></span>Google +</a></li></ul></div><a class="pull-left" href="#respond"><span class="fa fa-comment-o entry-icon"></span> Comments</a></li></ul></div></p>
<p>Set to the The Meters’ “Hand Clapping Song,” the gaggle of free-spirited models dance against a vanishing horizon in the campaign’s short film. A dreary sea-side promenade has never looked so chic.</p>
<p>The curious settings for both campaigns are intriguing, to say the least. From Miu Miu’s polka-dot hankerchiefs and striped stockings, to Prada’s vibrant checkered coats and handbags, both ads encourage pops of colour for fall.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the olden days, the members of Coldplay were primarily concerned with keeping pace with U2. But times change, and Chris Martin and Co. recently claimed that they’re now trying to compete with pop acts from across the genre spectrum—think Justin Bieber, Kanye West and Adele. With global hegemony in mind, Coldplay have once again recruited Brian Eno, who helps them veer further away from their maudlin, piano-led comfort zone.</p>
<div class="video-wrapper"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/1iIZeIy7TqM?showinfo=1&hd=0&rel=1&theme=light&controls=2" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>In one sense, it works—Mylo Xyloto finds the band at their most strident and celebratory—but every detail of the album is so sanded down it feels as though the melodies were put through rigorous focus-group testing in advance of the final mix. All the artistic progress made on their last album, the quirky and even adventurous Viva la Vida, has been undone, thanks to an overdose of weeping electronic strings, a pointless Rihanna cameo (on the forgettable “Princess of China”) and a festival-pleasing “ohh-ohh” hook that’s shoehorned onto the end of every boisterous chorus. Unfortunately, these lovingly crafted earworms won’t stand the test of time. There’s a reason Coldplay’s back-end ballads are the ones that still sound fresh after so many years—they’re the ones that emerged most organically from Martin’s eternally bleeding heart.</p>
<p>And sadly, heart is precisely what Mylo Xyloto lacks.</p>
<p>Playlist Picks: “Up With the Birds,” “Charlie Brown,” “Hurts Like Heaven”</p>
<p>The moody, piano-led ballad, which reaches Coldplay’s signature orchestral-rock aplomb by its midway point, was not only the first song the group had ever written specifically for a movie but its first new song since the release of 2011′s Mylo Xyloto. “Atlas” made it to the No. 1 position on 43 countries’ respective iTunes chart. In the U.S., it made it to No. 69 on the Billboard Hot 100 and peaked in the Top 20 of Billboard‘s Rock Songs and Alternative Songs charts</p>
<p>Martin is reportedly a fan of the Hunger Games series of books and based the song on the drama within the movie. “We are thrilled with how well they have connected to the themes and ideas within the film,” the movie’s director, Francis Lawrence, commented in September. “Their unwavering passion and excitement for the project elevated the collaboration even further.”</p>
<p>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire soundtrack, which features new tracks from Christina Aguilera, Sia and Lorde, among others, comes out November 19th. The movie hits theaters November 22nd.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-28-2" preload="none" style="width: 100%;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="https://upsidethemes.net/demo/passion/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/adg3com_bustedchump.mp3?_=2" /><a href="https://upsidethemes.net/demo/passion/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/adg3com_bustedchump.mp3">https://upsidethemes.net/demo/passion/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/adg3com_bustedchump.mp3</a></audio>
<p>Without any effort, we remain tethered to the Earth. Through, what very quickly after birth becomes an automated body function, we take in breath. In many respects, we live without really trying very hard to do so. As we age, two seemingly unrelated phenomena occur: we accumulate more and more baggage/emotional dross and we become inured to the marvels offered by just being alive. Gravity locates its characters in a setting that strips away the essentials that we take for granted every day in order to expose the pulsating, primal drives that often get buried beneath a numbing sense of apathy.</p>
<p>The basic premise of the film is that Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), a medical engineer on her first mission in space, and veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), must fight to survive after the debris from a destroyed satellite decimates their shuttle and sets them adrift. What viewers may not understand from the marketing materials that have been releases is that this is not a “floating around in space” movie. Once it gets going, Gravity is a non-stop, heart-pounding thriller.<div class="share-box pull-right"><ul class="clearfix"><li class="clearfix"><a class="pull-left t-first" href="mailto:?subject=Passion: Vinyl&amp;body=I%20recommend%20this%20page%3A%20Vinyl.%20You%20can%20read%20it%20on%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fupsidethemes.net%2Fdemo%2Fpassion%2F%3Fp%3D28"><span class="fa fa-envelope-o"></span>Mail</a><a class="pull-left" href="javascript:window.print();"><span class="fa fa-print"></span>Print</a></li><li class="clearfix"><div class="pull-left social-links"><span class="clearfix"><span class="fa fa-google-plus"></span>Share</span><ul><li><a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Vinyl:+https%3A%2F%2Fupsidethemes.net%2Fdemo%2Fpassion%2F%3Fp%3D28"><span class="fa fa-twitter"></span>Twitter</a></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fupsidethemes.net%2Fdemo%2Fpassion%2F%3Fp%3D28"><span class="fa fa-facebook"></span>Facebook</a></li><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fupsidethemes.net%2Fdemo%2Fpassion%2F%3Fp%3D28"><span class="fa fa-google-plus"></span>Google +</a></li></ul></div><a class="pull-left" href="#respond"><span class="fa fa-comment-o entry-icon"></span> Comments</a></li></ul></div></p>
<p>However, the real crux of the film is Kowalski and Stone’s vastly divergent responses to, not so much the crisis, but life. Stone is mourning, withdrawn, and disconnected, all business and oblivious to the purity of the wonder that is surrounding her. She is weightless with the expanse of space as her playground and the Earth a glowing globe beneath her, and yet, at the film’s open, the entirety of her being is focused on fighting intermittent nausea and the tool right in front of her. She is oblivious the the singular miracle of her circumstances. Whereas Kowalski is engaged with – and savoring – every moment of freedom that the jet pack the engineers are having him test affords him.</p>
<p>The pair function as archetypes as much as characters. They symbolize oppositional forces: yin and yang, the natural expansion and contraction of the universe, and spiritually, she stands in for a life-providing mother Earth and he a watchful, guiding, loving, though slightly irreverent, Father Deity. Kowalski is vital and life-affirming, Stone depleted and stricken by a devastating loss that she has been unable to move on from. The casting plays directly into audience expectations. We buy Clooney as the charming, devil-may-care astronaut and Bullock as the introverted, earthy and relatable scientist.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 7. We’ve had the rumours, we’ve had the help-the-newness-of-it-all-is-making-me-feel-sick phase, now it’s time for the tips and tricks]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple’s new operating system has refreshed the asthetics of your iPhone, but it’s also added several small, cool features and sorted out some old bugs we like the grumble about.</p>
<p>If you haven’t given in and updated yet, here’s 12 reasons why you should.</p>
<ol>
<li>Quit multiple apps at once<br />
Closing down apps to preserve battery life was one of the early ‘little known iPhone tips’. Now you can close several at a time. Double click the home button as usual, then use three fingers to swipe three apps at once.</li>
<li>Use the Instagram crop in camera mode<br />
The camera app can now take square photos, meaning whatever plate of food, Autumnal scene or vacuous selfie you want to share with the world on Instagram will always appear in full.</li>
<li>In built spirit level<br />
A niche tool, admittedly, but useful none the less. The compass app now also acts as a spirit level, meaning you can not only navigate your way around the world but perfectly straighten every picture you see on your way.</li>
<li>Siri can be corrected<br />
If you’re the type of person who doesn’t mind using voice activation on your mobile phone in public, at least you can now do it more accurately. Siri – whose voice you can also change – can be taught to get things right with a stern ‘that’s not how you pronounce that’. So now you can only talk to your phone, but tell it off, too.</li>
<li>Set your own vibrations<br />
Too much of a maverick for the basic 4/4 beat? OK jazz man, just go to Settings&gt;Sounds&gt;Ringtone&gt;Vibration&gt;Create New Vibration and you can set the iPhone to tickle your thigh to your own rhythm.</li>
<li>Block whoever you like<br />
Debt collectors, charity workers and unhinged exes can all now be block from your life for good via a handy new tool – just go to Settings&gt;Phone&gt;Blocked to get started.</li>
<li>Text message time stamps that last forever<br />
Settling an argument? Writing your autobiography? Providing a police alibi? All can be aided by the fact time stamps now last on every text message you send or receive forever, by just sliding them to the left.</li>
<li>The clock icon is a now real clock<br />
With a ticking second hand, and everything.</li>
<li>Maps has a night mode<br />
To help cut down on fatal car accidents and muggings, Apple maps now has a handy night mode, meaning the display will be darker and less distracting at certain times.</li>
<li>Unlimited folder space<br />
A great one for all you OCD sufferers out there. You can now places as many app icons in a single folder as you want, meaning your home screen can be as neat and tidy as you are.</li>
<li>Automatic app updates<br />
No more going into iTunes to get the latest version of Tinder – you can set your iPhone to be constantly updating apps automatically.</li>
<li>Birthday wishes<br />
The iPhone is now a bit cannier with the information you give it, meaning if you tell it your address, it can remind you to do things when you get home. Tragically, if you tell it your date of birth it will wish you well when the day arrives. You popular guy, you.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Swiftly making their way up the ranks as king of the fast-food world are the freshly prepared, simple, and dangerously moreish, burritos.</p>
<p>Here we round up five of the best places in London to grab one.</p>
<ol>
<li>Poncho 8Providing a healthier burrito option for the people of London (you can check the nutritional values online), ex-financial businessmen Frank Yeung and Nick Troen first set up shop in Spitalfields back in September 2009. They now boast five outlets including St Pauls and Soho.Using only the finest ingredients, Poncho 8 marinate their chicken in lime juice, cumin and paprika, while their pork is smothered in juniper berries, bay leaves and fresh oregano before slow cooked to juicy perfection.Their branded chili is also available from Harvey Nichols, and comes in three great flavours – Smoky Medium, Garlic and Super Hot Fuego (that’s ‘fire’ in Spanish).
<p>poncho8.com</li>
<li>ChilangoBack in 2006 founders Eric and Dan embarked on a gastronomical adventure to Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco (it’s a hard life) in order to bring the best of the Mexican flavours to London. And so far they’ve done a pretty good job.From chili-marinated steak to oven-braised pork – which includes the deliciously charred fatty edges, each burrito is filled with a generous dollop of coriander-lime rice, cheese/sour cream, beans and chunky homemade salsa.chilango.co.uk</li>
<li>Daddy DonkeyTucked away on Leather Lane, the self-proclaimed ‘kick-ass Mexican grill’ Daddy Donkey does exactly that – serve a kick-ass Mexican grill. Started by Joel Henderson back in 2005, the burrito cart serves the Daddy D burrito – a ‘big-ass’ flour tortilla with all the usuals. Choose from five fillings including Carnitas (pulled pork shoulder &amp; leg, slow cooked in garlic, spice and coca-cola) and marinated chargrilled chicken. And of course don’t forget to ask for a shot of guacamole at the end.With market-goers and lunchtime traders it gets pretty busy at lunchtime, so get there early to avoid disappointment.daddydonkey.co.uk</li>
<li>LuardosSince 2006, Luardos’ Jesus H Van (it’s blue) have been serving homemade burritos – also known to locals as the perfect hangover cure – stuffed with your choice of meat (chicken breast, carnitas, chipotle or beef), black beans, tomato salsa, sour cream, lettuce and fresh coriander. If you fancy a double dose of meat, you can always add extra chorizo.His hot sister van Mary (yes, it’s pink) is the one who ‘gets around’ so make sure you follow her on Twitter for regular updates on where she’ll be next. Expect a lengthy queue during lunchtimes.luardos.co.uk</li>
<li>Freebird BurritosDangerously close to the Esquire offices on Berwick Street Market, this burrito stand offers a fuss free, faster-than-light service.There are three easy steps to follow: pick the meal, pick the meat – our pick of the bunch is the tender medium-rare marinated steak – and add a generous portion of salsa. To really kick it up a notch we recommend you go for the Smoky Medium – a tomatillo based salsa with fresh herbs &amp; seasoning with, you guessed it, a smoky twist.</li>
</ol>
