<p>Forget the questionable egg mayo and Coronation chicken triangles you’ll find festering away in your local shop, because all over the country increasingly outrageous offerings are being peddled: pork banh mi from Vietnam, lobster rolls, giant Reubens and meatball subs. And they’ve got bigger; half the time you’ll find a knife and fork is required to actually tackle them. Usually thought of as being a cheap, deskbound snack, this new generation of sandwiches is often served up in high-end joints (and often with prices to match). Nor are these creations destined solely for lunch; people are gorging on them for dinner, too.</p>
<p>So why has the sandwich gone all decadent (not to mention international)? Helen Graves, author of the new book 101 Sandwiches: A Collection of the Finest Sandwiches from Around the World, suggests that this sandwich renaissance is in part down to recent food trends.</p>
<p>“I think US television programmes such as Man v. Food really introduced the public to these giant creations. People were saying, ‘Oh, Americans really do sandwiches differently’. That sort of food then became very popular and fashionable. There was a lot of so-called ‘dude food’ about, restaurants such as MEATLiquor. The street-food trend made a big difference, too: you can hold on to sandwiches and they’re easy to eat while standing.”</p>
<p>The rise of street food certainly should be held accountable: the popular food trucks that do well go on to become proper restaurants. Then, before you know it, everyone is eating variations of sandwiches while dining out. There is also the sheer array of sandwiches from around the globe, introducing the hungry to all types of exotic fillings and breads.</p>

<p>Chefs are keen to experiment, too. Recent eye-popping creations include the ramen noodle burger and the mac-and-cheese burger (in this carb wonder, the noodles and macaroni are transformed into the bun). And, yes, burgers are counted as sandwiches. “Really I would say that anything enclosed in bread is a sandwich,” says Graves. “But I am quite flexible. I would argue that a burrito is a sandwich, and I have included a recipe for one in the book. A hot dog is, too. A calzone, however, is not. But I don’t mind letting certain things in. For instance, I put in a recipe for an open sandwich because in Scandinavia they are a classic. We shouldn’t be too uptight about what qualifies as a sandwich.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we think of cardiovascular health, physical activity – such as running – often comes to mind. But new research shows that running a marathon can prompt heart muscle changes that cause the heart to swell, and this is particularly the case in runners with lower fitness levels.</p>
<p>The researchers, who reported their findings in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology, say previous studies have found that many sports competitors show signs of injury to the heart muscle and cardiac abnormalities after they exercise for long periods of time.</p>
<p>The new study was created to assess the degree to which running a marathon stresses the heart, and whether it might cause permanent damage.</p>
<p>As such, the researchers studied 20 amateur long-distance runners between the ages of 18 and 60, who were going to run in the Quebec City Marathon. The runners had no known cardiovascular disease and were not on any kind of drug treatment.</p>
<p>The researchers excluded any runners who had run a marathon in the 2 months before recruitment or during the study period.<br />
Cardiac risk associated with running</p>
<p>Tested 6-8 weeks before the marathon and on the day of the race, the runners were also tested again within 48 hours of completing the marathon. This test included a second MRI and blood sampling.</p>
<p>The researchers say this timeframe ensured sufficient rehydration and a return to normal heart and blood pressure rates after the race. But importantly, it was short enough for them to observe any myocardial changes.</p>
<p>In half of the runners, researchers observed that the marathon prompted a decrease in left and right ventricular function. And when a lot of the heart was affected, there was swelling and reduced blood flow in the heart.</p>
<p>Dr. Eric Larose, of the Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec (IUCPQ) in Canada, says that the heart muscle changes they observed were more common in runners who had lower fitness levels and who trained less.</p>
<p>But they also observed that these changes were temporary.</p>
<p>Dr. Larose says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Segmental function decrease is associated with poor prognosis in the presence of CAD (coronary artery disease) or cardiomyopathy. Segmental dysfunction also indicates a poor prognosis in adults without cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>Although we don’t know whether such changes mean that recreational runners are at risk, the attendant edema, and reduced perfusion suggest transient injury</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-111-4" preload="none" style="width: 100%;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="https://upsidethemes.net/demo/passion/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/adg3com_bustedchump.mp3?_=4" /><a href="https://upsidethemes.net/demo/passion/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/adg3com_bustedchump.mp3">https://upsidethemes.net/demo/passion/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/adg3com_bustedchump.mp3</a></audio>
<p>Given the ubiquity of street photography, it can now be easier to trend-spot outside fashion shows than inside. Case in point: the big and bold retro skirts so many women were wearing at the shows last month. You almost expected Carmel Snow to pull up in a Cadillac Brougham. Zanita Morgan, a model turned blogger and photographer, was a latter-day Grace Kelly in a voluminous skirt and angora sweater; Eva Chen, the Lucky editor, was uptown chic in a brocade Tibi; and Eleanor Strauss, the style director of Shopbop, wore a shorter style with a fitted crop top and leather jacket. While the days are still mild, you can pull off a hint-of-skin top under a leather jacket or peacoat.</p>
<p>For winter, try a relaxed-fit pullover and a waist-cinching coat that hits a few inches above the hemline of the skirt. Or for a different play on proportions, match with a slim turtleneck and short boxy jacket. On your feet: tall boots or ladylike heels. And, unless you’re perversely proud of your undergarments, beware of those subway grates.<br />
Under It All, the Poetry of Silk</p>
<p>True &amp; Co., an e-commerce site founded in 2012 to make bra shopping a less fraught experience — there’s an online fit quiz and a home try-on service — has enlisted Nikki Dekker of the cultish lingerie line the Lake &amp; Stars to design a private label collection. Called She Walks in Beauty (+ Light), Ms. Dekker’s collection (she’s also the site’s new creative director) is appealing in the way that Lake &amp; Stars is, with undies that can be layered and worn as outerwear. They’re done in luxe silk and a soft color palette, with patterned straps, cutouts and contrast closures, all at accessible prices of $24 to $94. This plunging bodysuit, available in black or mint with black straps, at $94, is a sexy piece to layer under a sharp jacket.

<p><strong>Worthy of a Song Or at Least A Bit of Boasting</strong></p>
<p>In its first season, Kara, a line of smart everyday handbags, was impressively picked up by Opening Ceremony, Harvey Nichols in London and Lane Crawford in Hong Kong. Designed by Sarah Law, who worked as an accessories designer at Gap, the line, including a pebble leather backpack that keeps selling out, is easy, cool and affordable. (The name is borrowed from one of her favorite activities, karaoke.) “I don’t really buy things that are over $1,000,” Ms. Law said of her moderate pricing. “I’ve maybe done it once in my life, and it was a really big deal.” Her new resort collection has backpacks and smaller stowaway bags in speckled cream calf-hair and mesh, but we are especially fond of this dry bag, which has an adjustable strap so it can also be carried as a bucket bag.</p>

<li>This is what we are doing.</li>
<li>This is how we are going to do it.</li>
<li>We can do it better if we get some money in.</li>
<li>This thing is going to happen with or without you.</li>

</ul>
<p>They have a feeling of inevitability about them. This team knows their shit. They are going to do this. Someone will fund them. If we don’t fund them, we’ll lose the deal.</p>
<p>This means that the majority of the content of the pitch deck should be content that the startup already has. Not content they created to impress investors.I help a lot of people with their pitch decks. Many of them, once they get an investor meeting on the calendar, scramble to put together a story:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is our business model?</li>
<li>Who is our competition?</li>
<li>What is our go-to-market?</li>
</ul>
<p>They anticipate these questions coming from the VCs, so they scramble to put together compelling answers.You don’t need answers to these question to impress VCs. You need the answers because you need the answers.</p>
<p>If you are throwing together answers to these questions purely to placate an investor, that means you don’t know the answers. It also means that you think the kind of annoying questions VCs ask, like “what is your sales model?” and “what is your lead generation strategy?” are just annoying investor speak and are not 90% of how you should be spending your time anyway.<div class="share-box pull-right"><ul class="clearfix"><li class="clearfix"><a class="pull-left t-first" href="mailto:?subject=Passion: Before Royalty&amp;body=I%20recommend%20this%20page%3A%20Before%20Royalty.%20You%20can%20read%20it%20on%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fupsidethemes.net%2Fdemo%2Fpassion%2F%3Fp%3D52"><span class="fa fa-envelope-o"></span>Mail</a><a class="pull-left" href="javascript:window.print();"><span class="fa fa-print"></span>Print</a></li><li class="clearfix"><div class="pull-left social-links"><span class="clearfix"><span class="fa fa-google-plus"></span>Share</span><ul><li><a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Before Royalty:+https%3A%2F%2Fupsidethemes.net%2Fdemo%2Fpassion%2F%3Fp%3D52"><span class="fa fa-twitter"></span>Twitter</a></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fupsidethemes.net%2Fdemo%2Fpassion%2F%3Fp%3D52"><span class="fa fa-facebook"></span>Facebook</a></li><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fupsidethemes.net%2Fdemo%2Fpassion%2F%3Fp%3D52"><span class="fa fa-google-plus"></span>Google +</a></li></ul></div><a class="pull-left" href="#respond"><span class="fa fa-comment-o entry-icon"></span> Comments</a></li></ul></div></p>
<p>A VC will not ask you a single question that you shouldn’t have come up with on your own, and if you don’t already have solid answers to them, you aren’t ready to raise money.</p>
<p>VCs can sniff out the difference between entrepreneurs who are asking permission to start their business vs. ones who know their shit and will do it with or without them.</p>
<p>Treat VC as a means to an end, not as the people you need to ask permission to before you can start your business. Investors respond to that and are likely to jump on board.</p>
