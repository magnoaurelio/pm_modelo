<p>Forget the questionable egg mayo and Coronation chicken triangles you’ll find festering away in your local shop, because all over the country increasingly outrageous offerings are being peddled: pork banh mi from Vietnam, lobster rolls, giant Reubens and meatball subs. And they’ve got bigger; half the time you’ll find a knife and fork is required to actually tackle them. Usually thought of as being a cheap, deskbound snack, this new generation of sandwiches is often served up in high-end joints (and often with prices to match). Nor are these creations destined solely for lunch; people are gorging on them for dinner, too.</p>
<p>So why has the sandwich gone all decadent (not to mention international)? Helen Graves, author of the new book 101 Sandwiches: A Collection of the Finest Sandwiches from Around the World, suggests that this sandwich renaissance is in part down to recent food trends.</p>
<p>“I think US television programmes such as Man v. Food really introduced the public to these giant creations. People were saying, ‘Oh, Americans really do sandwiches differently’. That sort of food then became very popular and fashionable. There was a lot of so-called ‘dude food’ about, restaurants such as MEATLiquor. The street-food trend made a big difference, too: you can hold on to sandwiches and they’re easy to eat while standing.”</p>
<p>The rise of street food certainly should be held accountable: the popular food trucks that do well go on to become proper restaurants. Then, before you know it, everyone is eating variations of sandwiches while dining out. There is also the sheer array of sandwiches from around the globe, introducing the hungry to all types of exotic fillings and breads.</p>

<p>Chefs are keen to experiment, too. Recent eye-popping creations include the ramen noodle burger and the mac-and-cheese burger (in this carb wonder, the noodles and macaroni are transformed into the bun). And, yes, burgers are counted as sandwiches. “Really I would say that anything enclosed in bread is a sandwich,” says Graves. “But I am quite flexible. I would argue that a burrito is a sandwich, and I have included a recipe for one in the book. A hot dog is, too. A calzone, however, is not. But I don’t mind letting certain things in. For instance, I put in a recipe for an open sandwich because in Scandinavia they are a classic. We shouldn’t be too uptight about what qualifies as a sandwich.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Until recently – this week, in fact – we hadn’t considered the gastronomic possibilities that the pairing of oysters and whisky might bring.</p>
<audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-16-4" preload="none" style="width: 100%;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="https://upsidethemes.net/demo/passion/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/adg3com_bustedchump.mp3?_=4" /><a href="https://upsidethemes.net/demo/passion/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/adg3com_bustedchump.mp3">https://upsidethemes.net/demo/passion/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/adg3com_bustedchump.mp3</a></audio>
<p>Sure, they’re each tasty, manly things in their own right – but that doesn’t mean that they’re as destined as say, bacon and chicken, or sex and cigarettes.</p>
<p>Thanks to a group of oyster connoisseurs who call themselves The Mother Shuckers (!), oysters and whisky has become a reality with a new Covent Garden pop-up. The Shuckers have teamed up with the Scotch Malt Whisky Society, who are responsible for sourcing an incredible selection of high-end, short-run British whisky.</p>
<p>The temporary space is called Pearl Dram. Naturally.</p>
<p>So what the hell happens to one’s palette when it’s lavished with smokey cask whisky and sea-salty oysters?</p>
<p>Very, very good things.</p>
<p>The dance of buttery, smooth oyster – so flavoursome they’re wholly devoid of garnish – and light, floral whisky is mesmerising.</p>
<p>Pearl Dram has six pairings to eat and drink your way through. In a rogue turn, you’re encouraged to chew and saviour the oysters, taking in the notes in the same fashion you might do with, say…a whisky.</p>
<p>Our pick of the bunch? A 16 year old, slightly salty marmalade-tinged whisky, which was partnered up with the creamy, flavour-loaded Colchester oyster: a one-two punch you’ll be glad to take.</p>
<p>If we’re being entirely honest, you ought to work your way through the selection twice – for posterity, and because, dang, deep-sea British oysters and premium cask whisky have been kept apart for far, far too long.</p>
<p>The Pearl Dram Whisky and Oyster Bar is popped-up at 53 Monmouth Street, Seven Dials, London, WC2H 9DG from Thursday 5 September to Sunday 8 September (Thurs-Sat noon-9pm, Sun noon-5pm). Entry is free.</p>
